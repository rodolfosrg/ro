My name is Rodolfo, but I prefer to go by Ro. I was born and raised in the beautiful country of [🇬🇹 Guatemala](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZNyZb2dvmCSnziVJ7), where I live with my wife Ana, our son Martín, and our dog Kupa.

I love organizing information and helping people become the best version of themselves which I have had the opportunity to do for the last 7 years as a software development manager.

I've been a member of [Iglesia El Mensaje de Vida](https://www.elmensajedevida.org/) (The Message of Life Church) for as long as I can remember, where I serve in the worship ministry as a musical director and pianist.

I have a passion for serving children and was able to do so as part of [Alianza Cristiana para los Huérfanos](https://www.achlatam.org/) (Christian Alliance for Orphans in Guatemala), volunteering for [Boys Hope Girls Hope](https://esperanzajuvenil.org/) and currently at [Compassion International](https://www.compassion.com/) as a solutions engineering manager for Latin America and the Caribbean.

I enjoy playing video games in my free time, but recently, I've also taken up writing as a hobby.

Lately, I've been writing my thoughts, lessons learned, and devotions to share with my friends and colleagues. This site serves as a digital archive making it easier for anyone to access, share, and find inspiration from what I've documented.
