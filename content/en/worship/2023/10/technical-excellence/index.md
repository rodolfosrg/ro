Regular practice and setting time aside for personal formation is crucial for any member of a worship ministry. As musicians or singers, continuously improving our abilities in worship leading effectively is essential.

The bible reminds us in Colossians 3:23-24 NIV [^1]

> Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

This passage reminds us that our job as musicians in a worship band is not for our own benefit, but for glorifying God and nurturing His Church.

Commit yourself to regular practice and setting the necessary time aside to serve the Lord to the best of our skill.
