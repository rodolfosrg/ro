Psalms 29 is a beautiful psalm that celebrates the majesty and power of the Lord. It invites us to stand in awe of the effects of His voice over creation, displaying His authority and sovereignty over us and the world around us. **Open your heart to the transformative power of the voice of the Lord!**

The psalm begins with a call to worship, reminding us that the Lord is worthy of glory, power and majesty.

> **1** Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings,  
> ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.  
>
> **2** Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;  
> worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.

The psalmist is talking directly to 'heavenly beings'—translated as 'sons of the mighty'—and is commanding them to 'ascribe' or 'attribute' glory and strength to the Lord. This doesn't mean He wasn't glorious or strong before, but that all should recognize that glory and strength belong to the Lord and should be attributed to Him in praise and prayer.

Pray: _"Father, I surrender to your majesty by recognizing your glory and infinite power. You are the only one that deserves glory and the best of my praise. I pray that every breath I take, every word I speak and every action I make be in testimony of your greatness."_

The second part of the psalm describes the voice of the Lord:

> **3** The voice of the Lord is over the waters;  
> the God of glory thunders,  
> the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.  
>
> **4** The voice of the Lord is powerful;  
> the voice of the Lord is majestic.

The association between thunder and the voice of the Lord is introduced in this section as a poetic analogy. This is an example of the Lord displaying His power and majesty through creation.[^1] The Lord uses the thunder to reference how His voice comes from the highest, without warning, making a sound louder than any other, inspiring awe and respect, all without any possible human intervention.

[^1]: See also Psalms 19:1

Pray: _"Oh powerful Savior, I am in awe of your divine works revealed to us through your creation. When marveling at the inmensity of the universe and the beauty of nature, I give you my whole being while looking for your guidance in every moment."_

Starting in verse five, the psalmist presents examples of the transformative power of the voice of the Lord.

> 5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;  
> the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
>
> 6 He makes Lebanon leap like a calf,  
> Sirion like a young wild ox.
>
> 7 The voice of the Lord strikes  
> with flashes of lightning.
>
> 8 The voice of the Lord shakes the desert;  
> the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
>
> 9 The voice of the Lord twists the oaks  
> and strips the forests bare.
> And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”

The cedars of Lebanon are famous for their size and strength, but the voice of the Lord is stronger and capable of breaking them easily. Mount Hernon (or Sirion[^2]) is a group of mountains more than 2000 meters high, but the voice of the Lord is so powerful that it can move them and even make them leap!

[^2]: "(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)" -Deuteronomy 3:9

The inevitable result of these observations is worship and praise. Before the majesty and transformative power of the voice of the Lord, we can't but surrender completely and worship, for only the Lord is worthy to be praised.

Sing: [How great thou art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-m_6KN5ISA)

The psalm ends by reaffirming the Kingdom of the Lord.

> 10 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;  
> the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
>
> 11 The Lord gives strength to his people;  
> the Lord blesses his people with peace.

The Lord reigns over the whole earth, over nature and mankind, but in His infinite love and mercy, He uses His power to make us strong and bless us.

The voice of the Lord reveals his power and glory. It calls us out to surrender ourselves to Him and live a life of worship and praise. By living according to the Lord's will, we demonstrate our love and respect, allowing Him to take His rightful place as our King.

Pray: _"Dear Lord, I worship you for you are great and powerful. You are King of kings and Lord of lords. Your strength has no measure and your kingdom has no limits. Thank you, oh Lord, for revealing your glory through your creation and allowing me to marvel in your works! I confess I am nothing next to your greatness, but you still bless me with abundant life and the privilege to serve and worship you. I lay my life before you knowing that your power is made perfect through my weakness. Glorious Father, I raise my voice and join the psalmist declaring that you are enthroned as King forever, you give strength to your people,and you bless your people with peace. All the glory and power are yours, now and forever. Amen."_
