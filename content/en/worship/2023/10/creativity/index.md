One of the most common mistakes we Christians make, and especially musicians in worship groups, is mistaking humility with mediocrity. God wants humble hearts, but that doesn't mean he settles for mediocre praise. In the Bible we can learn how God reveals his glory through his creation and through the talents and abilities He has bestowed upon us.

In Genesis 4:3-5, we find the story of Cain and Abel.

> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. [...]

In this story, both brothers present an offering to the Lord. Each brother offered the product of his work. Cain was a farmer and brought some crops. Abel was a shepherd and presented some of his sheep.

The text does not specify what the nature of Cain's mistake was. We do not know if he maybe brought the leftover product, the one that was easiest to harvest, or if it was actually the best quality. The text does not clarify the intention of their hearts either, but what we do know is that Abel presented the best of his flock and that the Lord accepted Abel's offering while he rejected Cain's.

If we analyze the situation superficially, we could argue that Abel was not humble, that he was boasting about his talents as a shepherd and that by presenting the best sheep, he was undervaluing his brother's offering. But we know that the Lord did accept Abel's offering, and since God could see the intentions of his heart, we trust that his intentions were not arrogant.

Some Christians may quickly judge those who, as a result of the outward expression of their praise and creativity, attract attention to themselves or who seem to be boasting about their talents. In the most extreme cases, we even veto any kind of creative expression, arguing that it shows a lack of humility. The result we end up achieving is fostering a culture of mediocrity in which our offerings and praise do not reflect the greatness, richness and creativity of God.

### God made us creative

In Genesis 2:19-20, God gave Adam the responsibility of naming all the animals.

> Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. [...]

When God asked Adam to name the animals, it was not because He did not have the power to do it Himself. By entrusting this responsibility to Adam, God makes us participants in the story of creation. God invites us to interact deeply with creation. To name the animals, Adam had to understand them, categorize them, and assign them value. This is humanity's first act as stewards of creation according to His command in Genesis 1:28.

 > God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

One of the first tasks God gave humanity was intrinsically creative! The act of naming animals reflects our ability to create, innovate and be creative.

### Using our talents to reflect the greatness of God

In Exodus 31:1-6, God names specific craftsmen, such as Bezalel, whom He endows with His Spirit to produce works of art as part of the plans for the tabernacle.

> Then the Lord said to Moses, “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you:

The Lord does not assign abilities at random nor solely for our personal enjoyment, but to serve Him and His church. God knows each of his children and wants us to use our abilities and creativity for his service.

In Colossians 3:23-24, the apostle Paul reminds us that everything we do, we must do for the Lord.

> Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

Again we see a connection between the heart and the quality of the result, which is to be performed 'as working for the Lord, not for human masters'. Talent applied with excellence, combined with a humble heart results in a faithful reflection of the glory and greatness of God.

### Creativity in music

Music is one of the artistic expressions that God uses as an example of praise throughout the Bible. The musicians chosen by David to serve in the temple are described in 1 Chronicles 25:6-7 as trained and skilled in music for the Lord.”

> All these men were under the supervision of their father for the music of the temple of the Lord, with cymbals, lyres and harps, for the ministry at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman were under the supervision of the king. Along with their relatives—all of them trained and skilled in music for the Lord—they numbered 288.

God chooses the best musicians for his service. This is because music, just like all of creation, expresses the glory and greatness of God.

### In conclusion

**Humility is a quality of the heart, not the quality of our actions.** God made us creative and gave us the privilege to use our talents and abilities in his service. We must be careful not to use our talents to draw attention to ourselves or to show off, but rather as the result of a life of worship and as an expression of the glory and greatness of God.
